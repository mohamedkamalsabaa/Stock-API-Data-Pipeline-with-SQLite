# Stock API Data Pipeline with SQLite

## Description
The Stock API Data Pipeline is a Python application that fetches real-time stock price data from a financial API, processes the data, and stores it in a local **SQLite** database. This project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs into a data pipeline and effectively manage and query stock data using a relational database.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: A programming language for the data processing pipeline.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing stock price data.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library for processing stock data.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests to the stock API.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing stock data.
