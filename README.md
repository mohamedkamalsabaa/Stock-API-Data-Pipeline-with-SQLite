# Stock-API-Data-Pipeline-with-SQLite
The Stock API Data Pipeline with SQLite is a simple application that fetches real-time stock price data from a financial API, processes the data, and stores it in a local SQLite database. This project demonstrates how to integrate external APIs into a data pipeline and work with a relational database to manage and query stock data.
